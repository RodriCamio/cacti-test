----[ Requirements

    1) Cacti 0.8.7 or higher.
    2) Cacti Plugin Architecture v2.0 or higher.
    3) MySQL 5.0.3 or above.
    4) PHP 4.3.8 or above (PHP 5.2.1 or higher are recommended)

    To upgrade "ReportIt" release 0.4.0 or higher is required.
    A prior version (0.1, 0.2, 0.3.0, 0.3.1, 0.3.2 or 0.4.0a) has to be completely uninstalled (mysql tables as well)!
    Therefore you can use uninstall.php.


    Optional:
    To use the full set of ReportIt's functionalities additional extensions are required

    1) Generation of archives:  PHP library "zlib"
    2) Generation of charts:    PHP library "GD2" in conjunction with "Freetype 2"
    3) Generation of emails:    Cacti Plugin "Settings" v0.5
    4) Fast report generation:  PHP extension "php_rrdtool"

----[ Installation

    The Installation of ReportIt is similar to other plugins:

    Unpack the tar-file into the plugins folder. It contains a folder called "reportit".
    Go to the Plugin Management Console and click on "Install".
    Start Cacti and update your realm permissions under "Utilities/User Management".
    Update ReportIt's settings under "Configuration/Settings/Reports".

----[ Upgrade

    To upgrade an existing version of ReportIt please ensure that its release number is v0.4.0 or
    above. It's strongly recommended to make a backup of your cacti database and your ReportIt folder
    before! If you're using the default archive folder of 0.6.x save it first!!!
    After that replace your existing ReportIt folder with the new one stored in this download archive.
    Go to the plugin management console and click on "install". The upgrade process will start automatically!
    After it has finished you can enable ReportIt with a click on "enable".

    ReportIt does not require that your webserver has write access to any folder.
    But if the history function should be in use, you will have to ensure that the user, who executes
    the calculation of your scheduled reports via Crontab or another scheduler,
    will have write access to the folders called "tmp" and "archive".
    Same has to be ensured for the export folder.
    At least change to the Cacti Webinterface and check the settings under "Console->Settings->Reports".
