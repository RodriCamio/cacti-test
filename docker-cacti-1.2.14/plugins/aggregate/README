    Version ........ 1.01
    Purpose ........ Build Aggregate Graphs from existing ones

*******************************************************************************/


----[ Purpose

    This plugin aggregates graphs from Graph Management.
    All data you want to see must already be present on any existing graphs.

----[ Features

    1) Aggregates existing Graphs into a single Aggregate Graph, keeping the sequence
       of selected Graphs and of the Graph Items within theses Graphs.
    2) Provides a new Graph Title for the Aggregate.
    3) Prepends all legend items with an optional text.
    4) Provides an algorithm to add additional <HR> linebreaks.
       This prevents ugly formatting.
    5) Allows for converting into AREA/STACK or LINE1 graphs
    6) Displays a list of Graph Items (taken from the first Graph selected) to allow
       for skipping selected graph items
    7) Allows for Totaling, either SIMILAR or ALL data sources
    8) Defines "Color Templates". These define a list of colors, e.g. light red to dark
       red. Allows to associate colored Graph Items to a Color Template. By doing so,
       Graph Items of same data source will no longer show the same color but instead
       will be colorized according to the Color Template

----[ Prerequisites

    Before you install Aggregate, you need to have met the following pre-requisites:

    - Cacti 0.8.7x 

----[ Installation

    Cacti 0.8.7x / Plugin Architecture V2.x:
       Please use the Plugin Management to install and enable the plugin    

    You must enable access to this plugin for all users other than the installing user

----[ Usage

    Please see attached aggregate_manual.pdf.
    The manual is linked the the aggregate prompt screen.

----[ Additional Help?

    If you need additional help, please goto forums.cacti.net.

----[ Possible Bugs?

    If you figure out this problem, let me know!!!

----[ Special Thanks

	The idea to create such a plugin was first mentioned by TheWitness, even if he
	preferred to work on Data Sources instead of Graphs.

----[ Future Changes

	When totaling, don't show legend items, on user request

    --- 0.75 ---
    Bug Fix: better index checking for color items
    Bug Fix: html validation errors fixed
    Bug Fix: xss vulnerabilities fixed
    Compat:  use buttons on action confirmation
    Compat:  compatibility with PIA 2.8
    Feature: Allow colors to rotate
    Feature: "Total only" implemented
    Feature: convert to all available LINEx graph item types
    Feature: custom prefix on total GPRINTs
    Feature: much more sophisticated graph item type conversion
    Feature: support for |query_*| substitution on data query graphs 
  
    --- 0.74 ---
    Bug Fix: color templates were broken
    Bug Fix: formatting of elements on the confirmation page fixed (unordered list)
    Feature: enhanced upgrade procedure will smoothly upgrade without loosing existing color templates

    --- 0.73 ---
    Bug Fix: pass graph actions to next plugin in queue
    Bug Fix: lot of html cleanup
    Feature: Support sort order, especially required if base graph is AREA/STACK type

    --- 0.71 ---
    Bug Fix: setup.php throws errors due to missing table keys
    Bug Fix: Allow "/" in title, e.g. for "/dev/sda1"
    Bug Fix: Disconnect aggregate graph items from graph template items, thus
            avoiding messing up aggregates when changing the "base" graph template

    --- 0.70 ---
    Feature: Support for Totalling, either for _similar_ or _all_ data sources
      This feature will automatically create any needed CDEF by replacing
      CURRENT_DATA_SOURCE by either
      SIMILAR_DATA_SOURCES_NODUPS or
      ALL_DATA_SOURCES_NODUPS
      But it first searches for any existing CDEF that matches!
      Those autocreated CDEFs will be named
      AGGREGATE SIMILAR <old CDEF name> or
      AGGREGATE ALL <old CDEF name>
    Feature: Allow for all |host_*| variables in AGGREGATE graph items
    Feature: remove unwanted |query_*| and |host_*| stuff from graph titles, 
      not making sense on AGGREGATES, e.g.
      Aggregate |host_description| - Traffic - |query_ifName|
      will turn to
      Aggregate - Traffic
      This will be displayed before graph is created.
    Feature: Do not ask for <HR> settings, compute them!
      If an item with <HR> is skipped, set <HR> on previous item
      Always set <HR> on last item of graph, so next graph starts "fresh"
    Bug Fix: "Assigning the return value of new by reference is deprecated"
      is a PHP5 compatibility issue
      Error Handler was changed to cope with this
    Bug Fix: Cleanup of code for creating the main graph structures
    Bug Fix: If Graphs based on different Graph Templates are used, drop an error
             e.g. aggregating
    - standard traffic
    - 95th percentile
    - bandwidth traffic
      will result in weird graphs. We will dop an error here,
      advising, that a single graph template is required for aggregation
      (To complete error handling, graphs.php needs a change)
    Tweak:	 Split up setup.php code. It contains plugin stuff only, now
      Aggregate functions have been moved to aggregate.php

    Tweak:	 Form Layout now matches standard Cacti Form Layout

    Feature: New "GPRINT Prefix", defaults to |host_hostname| to mimic previous behaviour

    Added checkboxes for <HR>. On specific Graph Templates, it will not be possible
        to compute all needed <HR>s. So we prompt you to set them manually.
    bug: LINEx graphs converted to AREA/STACK will now have AREA on the first graph items
